# bigquery-repo

This is a repository for my BigQuery project in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It is just a training repo and a collection of script that I used for training using BigQuery. This script is aimed at public dataset from BigQuery `data-to-insights` in `ecommerce` schema and `rev_transactions` table.

Requirements:
1. Google Cloud Platform account.
2. BigQuery.

Step to produce:
1. Open Google BigQuery.
2. Pin dataset `data-to-insights`.
3. Simply copy the script in `SQL Script Command` file. In case you can't open `.sql` file, I already set up a `.txt` file to access.
4. Copy the script to your query. Note: Don't forget to change the project name since it's done in my own Google Cloud Project.
